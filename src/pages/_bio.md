I'm a software engineer who's passionate about infrastructure, automation, and open source software. While I have a lot of experience working with Java and Kotlin, I am always willing to learn something new.

For the last few years, I've been a software engineer at [Discord](https://discord.com) on the Realtime Infrastructure team, building and scaling servers to millions of users.

Some of the projects that I've been working on include [KirBot](https://kirbot.mrkirby153.com) and [Giveaways](https://giveaways.mrkirby153.com). Check out the list of projects below for more projects that I've worked on.
