summary: I built blog with Astro and Tailwind

Hello world! I finally replaced my old website with this new site powered by [Astro][1] and [Tailwind][2]. I'm primarily a backend engineer, so don't expect much when it comes to web design.

I don't have a lot of plans for this site, but if I ever want to write anything, this would be the place!

This site is also open source! Check it out [here][3].
